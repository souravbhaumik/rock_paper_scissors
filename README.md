Rock Paper Scissors game using Python

This is rock-paper-scissors game with python.
Assuming you're playing with computer.
You can choose your turn by entering a value of 1, 2 or 3.
Computer will also return you with a random number.
For each iteration both of you will get a value between rock, paper and scissors.
If you get better value then you win! Otherwise Computer wins!
As this is a small project, so this contains hardcoded logic. And also i can't find a loop or condition to do it in one line.
If anyone can find, it's better.
